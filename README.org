#+TITLE: my dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles for configuring my workstation. I use [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][stow]] to manage them, hence why everything is under its own module, so I can use ~stow */~ to symlink them to the right place.

This configuration uses git submodules in order to pull some plugins and to integrate my Emacs config in a separate repository, so make sure to initialize them before trying to install it (installation instructions below).

* Installing
You could install it on any Linux distribution that you want, but I recommend Arch Linux as there is a file containing a list of required packages installable via pacman or your favorite AUR helper.

- Clone the config in your home directory ~git clone git@github.com:nezia1/dotfiles.git ​~/.dotfiles~
- Initialize submodules with ~git submodule update --init~
- If you're using Arch Linux, install the packages with ~sudo pacman ​-S < packages~ or using your favorite AUR helper
- ~stow */~ to symlink everything to the right place
- ~fisher update~ to install fish plugins
  
* Theme
I use [[https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin][catppuccin]] as my theme (the mocha variant). I love the soothing pastel colors. The GTK theme and the Qt5 theme are also configured to be used with supported applications.

* Shell setup
I use [[https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell][fish]] as my interactive shell, but I still keep [[https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/][bash]] as my non-interactive shell for compatibility purposes, as some pieces of software that I use require the user to have a POSIX compliant shell. This is why I have a bash module, where I setup everything that I want to have non-interactively and interactively and if running interactively, have it start a fish session.

It also keeps variables set in .profile, since we're starting fish from bash.

* Software used
- Operating system: [[https://archlinux.org/][Arch Linux]]
- Window manager: [[https://hyprland.org][Hyprland]]
- Status bar: [[https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar][Waybar]]
- Application launcher: [[https://sr.ht/~scoopta/wofi/][wofi]]
- Terminal emulator: [[https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty][kitty]]
- Shell: [[https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell][fish]]
- Text editor: [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]]
- Notification daemon: [[https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst][dunst]]
- Password manager: [[https://www.passwordstore.org/][pass]]

Hyprland is configured to use a random wallpaper from the ~$HOME/.dotfiles~ directory, so you need to have your wallpapers in it.

* Services and timers

The user-services module contains different systemd daemons and timers that you might or might not need depending on your specific use-case:

- sync: a systemd timer that synchronizes my org directory using [[https://rclone.org/][rclone]] to a remote called drive (runs every 5 minutes)
