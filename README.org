#+TITLE: my dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles for configuring my workstation. I use [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][stow]] to manage them, hence why everything is under its own module, so I can use ~stow *~ to symlink them to the right place.
* Installing
You could install it on any Linux distribution that you want, but I recommend Arch Linux as there is a file containing a list of required packages installable via pacman or your favorite AUR helper.

- Clone the config in your home directory ~git clone git@github.com:nezia1/dotfiles.git ​~/.dotfiles~
- If you're using Arch Linux, install the packages with ~sudo pacman ​-S < packages~ or using your favorite AUR helper
- ~cd ​~/.dotfiles && stow */~ to symlink everything to the right place
* Theme
I use [[https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin][catppuccin]] as my theme (the mocha variant). I love the soothing pastel colors. The GTK theme and the Qt5 theme are also configured to be used with supported applications.

* Software used
- Operating system: [[https://archlinux.org/][Arch Linux]]
- Window manager: [[https://hyprland.org][Hyprland]]
- Status bar: [[https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar][Waybar]]
- Application launcher: [[https://sr.ht/~scoopta/wofi/][wofi]]
- Terminal emulator: [[https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty][kitty]]
- Shell: [[https://www.zsh.org/][zsh]]
- Text editor: [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]]
- Notification daemon: [[https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst][dunst]]
- Password manager: [[https://www.passwordstore.org/][pass]]

Hyprland is configured to use a random wallpaper from the ~$HOME/.dotfiles~ directory, so you need to have your wallpapers in it.

* Services and timers

The user-services module contains different systemd daemons and timers that you might or might not need depending on your specific use-case:

- sync: a systemd timer that synchronizes my org directory using [[https://rclone.org/][rclone]] to a remote called drive (runs every 5 minutes)
